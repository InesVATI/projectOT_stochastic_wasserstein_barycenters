It would be more beneficial to re-code this in Python. Speed isn't crucial; the primary objective is to create simple 1D and 2D illustrations. For comparison purposes in 1D, you can compute the barycenter on a refined grid using the inverse cumulative function. The Sinkhorn code from the numerical tour can be utilized, and for a smaller epsilon, the "advanced Sinkhorn" tour, which incorporates stabilization for minuscule epsilon, is available. Additionally, POT can be employed, where barycenters are already implemented. Conducting numerical evaluations is crucial to determine the capability of their algorithm in computing the barycenter without implementing a grid, and to see if there are tangible benefits, either in precision or computational speed.
